# Results of Sentiment Analysis

## What is sentiment analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a way of judging how "positive" or "negative" a piece of text is. It's a rough number associated with the mood of a message. This particular sentiment analysis package was lifted from Python's NLTK, and was trained on Tweets and Movie reviews. Since this is judging Facebook Messenger messages, it's probably not _too_ far off from the right format.

The sentiment score is on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is as negative as possible and 1.0 is as positive as possible. When a message is mostly neutral, or total garbage, then the score assigns 0.0. Most messages are somewhere between -1.0 and 1.0.
